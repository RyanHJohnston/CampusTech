# Online Tech Store for College Students #
This was a final project for my Software Engineering class that I took in college. I'm going to rebuild the project to be production ready for the rest of the time I'm in college. Most work will be done in the winter break of 2023. If you're interested in helping, email me at ryanhjohnstoncollege@gmail.com, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.
